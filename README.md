# Algorithms

This repo contains work I did as part of a module in **Computational Thinking with Algorithms**. 

My final project, an investigation involving the benchmarking of various Sorting Algorithms is, contained in the notebook sorting_algorithms.ipynb

Week1_algorithms.ipynb contains very basic notes on operators and control structure in Python.
