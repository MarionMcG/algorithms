# Algorithms

This repo contains work I did as part of a module in **Computational Thinking with Algorithms**. 

My final project, an investigation involving the benchmarking of various Sorting Algorithms is, contained in the notebook sorting_algorithms.ipynb. You can view that file [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MarionMcG/algorithms/blob/master/sorting_algorithms.ipynb). Please be aware a full and comprehensive commit history wasn't required as part of this submission. 

Week1_algorithms.ipynb contains very basic notes on operators and control structure in Python.
